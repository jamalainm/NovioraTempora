Clothing - Provides a typeclass and commands for wearable clothing,
which is appended to a character's description when worn.

Evennia contribution - Tim Ashley Jenkins 2017

Clothing items, when worn, are added to the character's description
in a list. For example, if wearing the following clothing items:

    a thin and delicate necklace
    a pair of regular ol' shoes
    one nice hat
    a very pretty dress

A character's description may look like this:

    Superuser(#1)
    This is User #1.

    Superuser is wearing one nice hat, a thin and delicate necklace,
    a very pretty dress and a pair of regular ol' shoes.

Characters can also specify the style of wear for their clothing - I.E.
to wear a scarf 'tied into a tight knot around the neck' or 'draped
loosely across the shoulders' - to add an easy avenue of customization.
For example, after entering:

    wear scarf draped loosely across the shoulders

The garment appears like so in the description:

    Superuser(#1)
    This is User #1.

    Superuser is wearing a fanciful-looking scarf draped loosely
    across the shoulders.

- JI (12/7/19): I think I'll disable this functionality to start with

Items of clothing can be used to cover other items, and many options
are provided to define your own clothing types and their limits and
behaviors. For example, to have undergarments automatically covered
by outerwear, or to put a limit on the number of each type of item
that can be worn. The system as-is is fairly freeform - you
can cover any garment with almost any other, for example - but it
can easily be made more restrictive, and can even be tied into a
system for armor or other equipment.

To install, import this module and have your default character
inherit from ClothedCharacter in your game's characters.py file:

    from evennia.contrib.clothing import ClothedCharacter

    class Character(ClothedCharacter):

And then add ClothedCharacterCmdSet in your character set in your
game's commands/default_cmdsets.py:

    from evennia.contrib.clothing import ClothedCharacterCmdSet

    class CharacterCmdSet(default_cmds.CharacterCmdSet):
         ...
         at_cmdset_creation(self):

             super().at_cmdset_creation()
             ...
             self.add(ClothedCharacterCmdSet)    # <-- add this

From here, you can use the default builder commands to create clothes
with which to test the system:

    @create a pretty shirt : evennia.contrib.clothing.Clothing
    @set shirt/genus_vestīmentōrum = 'top'
    wear shirt
